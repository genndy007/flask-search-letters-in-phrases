This is my first Flask project. It is a web application.

Requirements
-------------
```
pip3 install Flask
```

Run
-------------
```
python3 main.py
```

How to use
------------
App runs at localhost:5000              
Use url entry '/entry' to request             
Or ignore any paths because it works automatically :)
